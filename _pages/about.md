Hello! Welcome to Wei Yue's home on the web! 

Currently, I am an MEng student at Cornell University, majoring in Financial Engineering. In June 2022, I graduated from a Joint-degree program of Jinan University and University of Birmingham, being awarded the Bachelor's degree in Economics and the First Class Honored Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics. The cross-descipline academic experience has strongly raised my interest in applying quantitative analytical skills to financial industry. 

I have various internship experiences, including global banking in China Construction Bank, IPO auditing in PwC and quant research in China Fortune Securities. I also conudcted several projects related to finance and economics. Some of the samples are displayed in the page "Projects". Now, this summer, I will work as a quantitative risk management intern at Morgan Stanley in Shenzhen. I am looking forward to exploring my career path of quantitative finance!

In my spare time, I love reading science fiction and detective novels. Video game is also a great time killer for me. Agatha Christie is one of my favorate writers and I love Hideo Kojima's games the best. I am operating a private channel, sharing my thoughts of books, games, movies and music with interetsing topics. Come and connect me on Linkedin if we share common interests or career goals!
